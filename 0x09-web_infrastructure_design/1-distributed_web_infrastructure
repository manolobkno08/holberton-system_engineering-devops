Distributed web infrastructure:
You should be able to explain some of the details of this infrastructure:
    - For each additional element, why you are adding it.
        a proxy server is added to work distributing requests based on the http and tsp protocol.
        It will be in charge of balancing the loads between the 2 servers.

    - What distribution algorithm is your load balancer configured with and how does it work?
        The algorithm is called Round-robin:
            - Round-Robin: requests are distributed among servers cyclically, regardless of server load. It distributes the
            requests evenly but not the load.
            - Weighted Round-Robin: Requests are delivered depending on the weight given to each server.
            - LeastConnection: Each request is served by the server with the least active connections at that time.
            - Weighted LeastConnection: Requests are delivered depending on the weight and number of connections.

    - Does your load balancer allow active-active or active-passive configuration?
        Our load balancer is configured in active-active mode:
            - Active-active solutions implement two or more active system instances and can be used to improve scalability
            and provide high availability. In active-active deployments, all instances handle requests at the same time.
            - Active-passive solutions implement an active instance that handles requests and a passive instance that is on standby.

    - How does a primary-replica (master-slave) database cluster work?
        Master-slave synchronization allows data to be replicated from one database server to other servers. When data is replicated,
        one server acts as the master server and the remaining servers act as slaves.

    - What is the difference between the primary node and the replica node with respect to the application?
        The difference is that the primary node is in charge of receiving the information, and the replica node is in charge of
        replicating the database of the primary node.


You should be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
    - Where are the SPOF
        This type of infrastructure does not have a firewall to filter malicious requests or malwares.
    - Security issues:
        There are no firewalls and no SSL server certificates are used to securely protect our private data, such as credit cards and
        online payments.
    - Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
    - No monitoring:
        There is no monitoring tool such as application or server monitoring, i.e. there are no statistics on how the resources
        of each server are being managed and functioning.
